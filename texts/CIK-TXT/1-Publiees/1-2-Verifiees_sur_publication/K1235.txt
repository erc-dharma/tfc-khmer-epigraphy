dhāryyate jagad aṣṭābhi- r a(ś)eṣaṁ yasya mūrttibhiḥ

III. [anuṣṭubh]
(3) = = (ru)gmam ivātyarttha- m aśobhata yaśodhanaḥ
Anvaye yo jagadvyāpi yaśasām avanībhujām·
% Pāda a: Before rugmam, we can see the lower part of what could be a ligature t: it would therefore be possible to restore [tap](taru)gmam.

III. who, rich in glory, shone intensely in the lineage of kings whose glories filled the universe, just as [[molten]] gold [shines].

yasya pratapatas samya- g abhūd avanimaṇdalam· 

IV. whose kingdom (avanimaṇḍalam), over which he reigned fully (pratapatas samyag), and which extended up to the boundaries that are the three oceans, was adorned with a single parasol.

V. [anuṣṭubh, a. na-vipulā : - - - - ~ ~ ~ - ]

dilīpasyāpi rājarṣe- r asamaf prathito guṇaḥ

V. That king drew towards himself not only the string (guṇaḥ) of his great bow, but also the famous unequalled virtue (guṇaḥ) of the king-sage Dilīpa.

(6) (ma)yy eva rūpasaṃpatti- r iti rūḍhām ahaṅkr̥tim·
Atyajan madano manye vapuṣmantam avekṣya [yam·]

VI. Having seen this beautiful king, it seems to me, Madana had to abandon the pride that had taken root in him for thinking “Perfection of beauty resides only in me”.

sarvvāsv adhikr̥to bhr̥tya Itikarttavyatāsu ya[ḥ]
% Pāda b: [kṛta]vedinām : for this restitution, see notes to the translation. The syllables in square brackets here are totally obliterated by damage to the stone.

VII. By this king of kings, a servant, the first among those who are conscious of what is done for them, has been employed to attend to all his duties.

vidyāviśeṣanāmābhū- d ācāryyo guruvatsal[aḥ]

tena setur ayaṁ vaddha- s saṅkramadvayakuṇdal[aḥ]

IX. In the śaka year counted by the (9) orifices [of the body], the (4) oceans and the (5) arrows [of the god of love], this causeway, characterised by round [holes] that give two passage-ways [for water to escape], was built by him.

X. [anuṣṭubh]
(10) [kr̥te] pu(ṇ)y(ā)dhik[āre smi-] n sa yajvā tena bhūbhujā
tamandarapurasvāmi- bhojakatve niyoji[ta](ḥ)

% Pāda a: The restored portions are restituted with the help of stanza XV of K. 604, which is almost identical to the present stanza. The present stanza confirms in turn that it is indeed puṇyādhikāre that one must read in K. 604, XVa!

X. Having accomplished this [deed] which gives right to merit, the same king appointed this founder as governor of Tamandarapura.

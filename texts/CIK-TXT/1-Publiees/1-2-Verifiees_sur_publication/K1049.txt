Let there be absolutely none of that which is non-success in me; and let the success of attaining Bhavahood (= Śivahood) come about in me; may this saṁsāra not come about for me; O Bhava, you alone, do you protect me completely here in this world (iha)!

In the Śaka year 86?, that compassionate prince of ascetics who was skilled in initiation, who consumed only milk and who, although knowledgeable in counting, was a teacher of grammar, desirous of obtaining the End of Suffering established himself with a group of sages in this cave of Śaṅkhapāni and by the good grace [of God] attained by his own will the pure destiny Dhruva.

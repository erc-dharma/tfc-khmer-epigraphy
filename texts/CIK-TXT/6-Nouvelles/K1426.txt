INTRODUCTION
DG: There are plenty of bilingual inscriptions from around this period.  Among those that explicitly allude to Jayavarman I (a much smaller corpus!), there is K. 493, of 579 śaka (657 CE), which by the way manifests nice clear instances of both k and r without long descendants loops (EFEO estampage n. 250).  
Cf. also K. 563 (EFEO estampage n. 414), which is similar to the Oc Eo one in its general decorative scheme at the top and bottom, its slightly less professional appearance, its use of Sanskrit and Khmer, and its use of “short” ka and ra. Cf. also K. 447, K. 49, K. 44. Of course the ka and ra with long pendentive loops can also be found, even much later in this same reign: e.g. K. 1004, EFEO estampage n. 1292.

Face A

I. [meter: anuṣṭubh, a and c: na-vipulā]
(1) jayaty aśeṣabhuvaṇa_dhvāntadhvaṅsanabhāskaraḥ
(2) jino vineyakamala_pravodhaprathitodayaḥ
	a. °bhuvaṇa°: read °bhuvana°.
	
He is victorious (jayati), the Buddha (jinaḥ), a sun to destroy darkness (dhvāntadhvaṅsanabhāskaraḥ) throughout the world, whose rise is proclaimed by the awakening of his lotus-like disciples (vineyakamalaprabodhaprathitodayaḥ).
	
II. [meter: anuṣṭubh, c: na-vipulā]
(3) dagdhe svatejasaivāri_vaṅśe niravaśeṣataḥ
(4)  vane (p)i ka(ṇṭa)kabhaya_m prajā yasya na lebhire
	c. The consonant part in pi looks like a ligature, but we think that this is just due to damage.  Cf. the width of the pi at the end of VIa. 

After he burnt (dagdhe) completely (niravaśeṣataḥ) the race of his enemies (arivaṅśe) merely (eva) by his fieriness (svatejasā), his subjects (prajāḥ) conceived (lebhire) no (na) fear of thorns (kaṇṭakabhaya) even [when they were] in a forest (vane ’pi).

% OR ...:  ... danger of enemies (other meaning of kaṇṭaka) ...
% Although the `burning of enemies' might in the context of the Buddha allude to the destruction of Māra, it seems more likely to us that this stanza speak about the king. The correlative yasya shows that this stanza is to go with the next two stanzas which contain yas and then tena each time denoting the king. The vocabulary (tejas, prajāḥ) also suggests that this stanza is only about the king.


III.  [meter: anuṣṭubh]
(5) caturāśramiṇā(ṁ) dharmma_samatām ānayan prajā(ḥ)
(6) yas samānārthatāyogā_t tulādaṇḍa qivābhavat·

Leading (ānayan) his subjects (prajāḥ) to a state of being in balance with the Dharma (dharmasamatām) of those belonging to the four [orthodox] walks of life (caturāśramiṇām), he became (abhavat), it seemed (iva), like the rod of a pair of scales (tulādaṇḍaḥ) [i.e. utterly impartial] because he possessed a sense of each [walk of life] being of equal value (samānārthatāyogāt).

%One could imagine a layer of meaning in which he  “was [straight] as the rod of a pair of scales because of [the fact that he was engaged in cultivating] a meditative state of awareness that all things are of equal value”.  Such a yogic awareness is spoken of as sāmarasya in Śaiva traditions, or as samarasa (e.g. in the Niśvāsa).
% Dominic: N.B. This is a strikingly "Hindu" image for a Buddhist dedication !

IV. [meter: anuṣṭubh]
(7) tena rājādhirājena _ nāmnā śrījayavarmmaṇā
(8) śrīcandanavihārāya _ dattam arthāya śāsanam·

This (tena) overlord of kings (rājādhirājena), by name Śrī Jayavarman, gave (dattam) the [following] charter (śāsanam) for the sake of wealth (arthāya) [given] for the benefit of the Śrī Candanavihāra:

V. [meter: anuṣṭubh, c: bha-vipulā]
(9) mādhave mādhave māsi _ pūrṇṇoditaniśākare
(10) [ta]thāgatasya pratimā_gamanan niyatotsavaṁ

“In spring (mādhave), in the month of Mādhava (mādhave māsi) [i.e., Vaiśākha], when the risen moon is full (pūrṇṇoditaniśākare), the procession of the image (pratimāgamanam) of the Buddha['s statue] (tathāgatasya) is to have a fixed festival (niyatotsavam).”

%AG and KC prefer `every month of Vaiśākha'.
%DG: I see that it is conceivable, but I am not convinced that it is better.  For me, it is the niyata which expresses the regularity, and not the repetition of mādhave, which I think is clever and elegant precisely because it is used in two different senses (for another consideration, see below).
%AG: why not pratimāgamanam niyatotsavam `the approaching of the Buddha image (for veneration) is to be connected with the festival' — image procession is not know to have been a cult practise in Buddhism, in Southeast Asia, is it?
%DG: This other interpretation of pratimāgamanam also seems conceivable, but again slightly less likely to me, since I would assume that the image was always there to be approached, not just on some calendrical festival. Festivals archetypically involve processions (in South India invariably so, to the point that utsava is often used to mean “procession”, e.g. in the expression utsavamūrti) and processions easily spread from faith to faith, because of imitation, since their doctrinal import may be felt to be secondary to their social value.  Here in Pondy, Catholics parade the Virgin on the annual anniversaries of the foundations of her churches, just as though she were a Viṣṇu or a Śiva (though I doubt there have ever been Gaṇikās in the Catholic processions!). For other Cambodian processions, cf. K. 290 (66–67 Buddhist, but probably calqued on a brahmanical model), K. 1222 (Śaiva), and K. 356 (a Vaiṣṇava processional image described as utsavayāyin !). 
%KC: I think the word ‘niyata’ is to qualify the festival or ceremony. Can we translate it something like ‘well-restrained’, I mean a ceremony in which the participants had to restrain themselves from sensual enjoyment and fixe their mind on the Buddha or his teaching? 
DG: This seems to me an anachronistically post-protestant interpretation ! The whole point of most festivals and festival processions (before the dreary spread of puritanism into almost all the world’s religions) was that they allowed a joyful inversion of norms.  This is, by the way, another reason for which I would like the first mādhave to mean “In Springtime !...”, a crucial time for joyous festivals all over the world from time immemorial. For me, as explained above, niyata conveys the calendrical regularity. We should be careful not to project back a post-Victorian Buddhist pietism. 

VI. [meter: anuṣṭubh, a: na-vipulā]
(11) [qeta](s)[y](ai) kena cid api _ śraddhayā pratipāditaṁ
(12) dāsago(mah)i(ṣ)ārāma_kṣetrakarmmakarādi yat·

“[And] whatever (yat) is dedicated (pratipāditam) to this [image] (etasyai), out of faith/devotion (śraddhayā) — slaves, cows, buffaloes, gardens, fields, servants and so forth — by anybody at all (kena cid api),

%DG (with slight adaptations by AG): As for dāsa and karmakara (who are presumably servants with a different legal status from the dāsas, perhaps because they are not as completely owned), the  Śaiva author Brahmaśambhu draws this distinction in his Naimittikakriyānusandhāna. According to this text (f. 73v), when the ācārya transfers his responsibilities to his successor,  he should say:
idaṁ sthānam iyaṁ vr̥ttir iyaṁ pustakasaṁhatiḥ
amī vai bharaṇīyās tu dāsāḥ karmakarāś ca naḥ
etat sarvaṁ mayā tubhyaṁ dattam adya tvayāpi ca
pālanīyaṁ tathā samyag yathāsmābhiḥ prapālitam
`Such is the foundation; such is the revenue; such is the library; and these are the slaves and workers that it is my duty to support. All this I have given to you this day, and you should properly maintain it as I have done.'

VII.
(13) tad ahāryyam asa[ṁ]bho(g)ya_m anivāryyaṁ svakarmmasu
(14) tamandarapurādhyakṣa_bhāro ya(m avagam)[yatām·]

“that (tad) is not to be stolen (ahārya), not to be enjoyed (asambhogya), not to be withheld (anivārya) for [the accomplishment of some individual’s] own works (svakarmasu). May this (ayam) be understood (avagamyatām) to be the burden [of duty] (bhāra) of the Governor of Tamandarapura.”

%% This is probably a successor to Vidyāviśeṣa, the governor of Tamandarapura who authored K. 604 and K. 1235 in 627 CE. See Goodall 2019.

ON TAMANDARAPURA (EMAIL PYM 14/11/2019)
Cher Arlo,
Intrigué par Tamandarapura, jamais jusqu'ici associé à Oc Eo, mais qui me rappelait quelque chose de déjà croisé, j'ai fait une petite recherche et j'ai retrouvé ce qui titillait ma mémoire.
De fait, le toponyme apparait dans deux inscriptions:
— la K.9 de Phu-huư provenant des limites sud de la Plaine des Joncs (L. Malleret, Musée Blanchard de la Brosse, Catal. général ... , I, Hanoï, 1937, n° 57, p. 70; Coedès, Inscriptions, V, p. 35-38).
— la K.604 de Sambor Prei Kuk (Coedès, Inscriptions ... , IV, p. 17, qui corrige Finot in BEFEO 1928, p.45-46 qui avait lu Tatandarapura). Coedès dit aussi que Tamandarapura est synonyme de Tamoghna). 
Tout ça est à approfondir, mais le fait qu'on trouve ce terme en trois lieux différents jette un doute sur le fait qu'il pourrait désigner la ville de Oc Eo. Dommage !

                  <summary>
                     <p>Face A contains seven Sanskrit stanzas in anuṣṭubh meter. The first is an invocation to the Buddha. Stanzas II and III praise the fieriness and righteousness of the ruling king Jayavarman I. The raison d’être of the inscription is mentioned in stanzas IV and V: these constitute an edict of King Jayavarman I concerning a monastery called Candana “sandalwood” <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>candana-vihāra</foreign></supplied> and they decree the use of funds <supplied reason="explanation">not given by the king</supplied> for the annual procession of the image of the Buddha on the full moon day of the month of Vaiśākha <supplied reason="explanation">April-May</supplied>. Stanzas VI and VII stipulate that the slaves, cows, buffaloes, gardens, fields, servants, etc., given to the Buddha are not to be stolen and are under the protection of the Governor of Tamandarapura.</p>
                     <p>Face B is a fourteen-line text in Old Khmer. It echoes the Sanskrit text in what is said about the annual procession of the Buddha’s statue of Candana Monastery on the full moon day of Vaiśākha as an order of King Jayavarman I. It also provides details of the management of the wealth of the monastery including servants, slaves, cows, buffaloes etc. The last two lines warn that those who flout the order of the king shall be punished.</p>

The stela has no tenon at its base, but the bottom 15 cm were left blank, as though this part was originally intended to be inserted into the ground or into a stone mortise. When discovered, it lay on the ground, somehow broken into two fragments on one face and in four fragments on another. The pre-modern breakage has not been repaired yet. The stela is now kept in the storage room of Óc Eo Museum.<note>At the time we finish this article, none of us has yet had the chance to observe the stone directly. We rely on information shared by Nguyễn Khánh Trung Kiên <supplied reason="explanation">2019</supplied> and Đỗ Trường Giang <supplied reason="explanation">2023</supplied></note></p>
            <p>The stela is inscribed on its two broad faces, face A in Sanskrit verse and face B in Old Khmer prose. Both faces are decorated with a blossoming lotus above one or two strings of pearls <supplied reason="explanation">two on A, only one on B</supplied> at the top of fourteen lines of text and one string of pearls below the text on each face. The Khmer text runs continuously in one column whereas the Sanskrit one is arranged in two columns, even-numbered verse quarters <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>pāda</foreign></supplied>s in one and odd-numbered ones in the other. Both texts are written in an early form of Khmer script typical of the second half of the seventh century, without long descenders on the characters <foreign>ka</foreign> and <foreign>ra</foreign>. Since no other king going by the name Jayavarman is known to have ruled in the seventh century, it is clear that the king Jayavarman mentioned in the Sanskrit text must have been Jayavarman I <supplied reason="explanation">657–681 CE</supplied>. Besides its paleographic aspect, the inscription shares two main features of its content with other inscriptions of the same king: the opening expression <foreign>ājñā vraḥ kamratāṅ añ ni</foreign> “order of My Lord” <supplied reason="explanation">with addition of the particle ni where the inscriptions belonging to the reigns before and after use the phrase <foreign>ājñā vraḥ kamratāṅ añ</foreign> without said particle</supplied> and the details of the threat of punishment at the end of the Khmer portion.<note>For discussion of the characteristics of the inscriptions of King Jayavarman I, see Vickery (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Vickery1998_01"/><citedRange unit="page">26, 165–168</citedRange></bibl>), and for his dates see Goodall and Revire (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Goodall+Revire2021_01"/><citedRange unit="page">271</citedRange><citedRange unit="note">21</citedRange></bibl>).</note></p>
        <p>The character <foreign>ra</foreign> consists of a double stroke and does not extend farther down than the body of other characters. While the subscript of the character ṇa in the word pūrṇṇamī in the Khmer text and pūrṇṇodita- in the Sanskrit one still preserves the ‘‘x’’ shape <supplied reason="explanation">characteristic of the fifth and sixth centuries</supplied>, the character <foreign>ṇa</foreign> above it has the two sides of the ‘x’ split and connected by a stroke at the bottom. The decoration of the stela and the paleographic characteristics of the script present similarities with several other inscriptions of Jayavarman I. The stela from Phum Chrei <supplied reason="explanation">K. 563, Kompong Speu, 7th century CE</supplied>, for example, also has a decorative lotus at the top and a string of pearls below the text. The character ka does not have a long descendant loop, except the ones in the lines 9 and 12 of the Sanskrit text. The dominance of the ka without the descendant loop can also be found in the doorjamb from Tuol Kuk Preah <supplied reason="explanation"><ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00493.xml">K. 493</ref>, Prey Veng, 657 CE</supplied>; by contrast, the stela from Preah Kuhea Luong <supplied reason="explanation"><ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00044.xml">K. 44</ref>, Kampot, 674 CE</supplied> presents more characters ka with the descendant loop than the other type, whereas the two types are equally represented in <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00563.xml">K. 563</ref>. The shapes of the vowel-markers  markers <foreign>i</foreign> and <foreign>ī</foreign>. The first one is written as a round small circle and the latter is slightly larger with a horizontal stroke in the middle. In some cases, the vowel marker <foreign>ī</foreign> appears like a spiral turning to the left, which is comparable to that in the inscription <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00493.xml">K. 493</ref>.</p>
            <p rend="stanza" n="1">As Diwakar Acharya pointed out to us <supplied reason="explanation">personal communication of 28.vi.2023</supplied>, <foreign>vineya</foreign> could refer also to the king’s subjects <supplied reason="explanation">for cf. vinayādhāna in Raghuvaṁśa 1.24</supplied>. This means that a second punning interpretation is at least suggested, even if it is not perhaps meant to expand fully in the mind of the reader, in which the king is the subject of the stanza, his name, Jayavarman, being already adumbrated or suggested by the opening word:
         He is victorious, that Victor <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>jinaḥ</foreign></supplied>, a <supplied reason="subaudible">veritable</supplied> sun for destroying the darknesses of all the world, whose rise spreads out to awaken the lotuses that are <supplied reason="subaudible">his subjects who are</supplied> to be disciplined. For a handful of comparable instances of pre-Angkorian Śaiva inscriptions that open with a verse that is manifestly in praise of Śiva but that allow themselves also to be interpreted as referring to the ruling king, see Goodall and Revire (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Goodall+Revire2021_01"/><citedRange unit="page">270</citedRange></bibl>). This is a trope we find elsewhere, for instance in the 5th-century Guḍnāpur pillar inscription from Karnataka <supplied reason="explanation">India</supplied>, commemorating the creation and endowment of a temple of Kāmadeva. Its first verse, as Cecil and Gomes suggest (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Cecil+Gomes2021_01"/><citedRange unit="page">16</citedRange><citedRange unit="note">16</citedRange></bibl>), could describe both Kāma and the ruling king Ravivarman.</p>
            <p rend="stanza" n="2">The use of <foreign>kaṇṭaka</foreign> <supplied reason="explanation">literally “thorn”</supplied> to refer metaphorically to enemies or trouble-makers within the realm is an old cliché <supplied reason="explanation">see for example Raghuvaṁśa 14.73</supplied>. One is thus meant to understand <foreign>kaṇṭakabhayam</foreign> simultaneously as “fear of thorns” and “danger of trouble-makers”. Although the “burning of enemies” might in such a Buddhist context allude to the destruction of Māra, it seems more likely to us that this stanza speaks about the king. The correlative <foreign>yasya</foreign> shows that this stanza is to go with the next two stanzas which contain yas and then <foreign>tena</foreign>, each time denoting the king. The vocabulary <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>tejas</foreign>, <foreign>prajāḥ</foreign>, <foreign>arivaṁśe</foreign></supplied> also suggests that this stanza is only about the king.</p>
           <p rend="stanza" n="3">One could imagine a layer of meaning in which he  “was <supplied reason="subaudible">straight</supplied> as the rod of a pair of scales because of <supplied reason="subaudible">the fact that he was engaged in cultivating</supplied> a meditative state of awareness that all things are of equal value”. Such a yogic awareness is spoken of as sāmarasya in Śaiva traditions, or as <foreign>śaktisamarasa</foreign> <supplied reason="explanation">e.g. in 5:36 of the Uttarasūtra of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā and in 4:61 of the Nayasūtra, both edited in Goodall et al. (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Goodall+al2015_01"/></bibl>)</supplied>.</p>
           <p rend="stanza" n="4">As Diwakar Acharya observed to us <supplied reason="explanation">personal communication of 28.vi.2023</supplied>, the combination of a genitive and a dative <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>candanavihārasya arthāya</foreign></supplied> would be more normal for expressing this sense.  Nonetheless, the first dative could be the result of attraction to the case of the second. Or we can interpret as we have, with two parallel purposive datives: “for wealth” and, at the same time, “for the vihāra”. He further suggested that arthāya might mean simply “for the purpose / sake of”.  So “he gave this charter for the sake of the Śrī Candana Monastery”. Note that it is not said that the king made any donation himself. Pre-Angkorian inscriptions that record expenditure by the ruling king seem to be rare <supplied reason="explanation">Goodall (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Goodall2023_01"/><citedRange unit="page">27–36</citedRange></bibl></supplied>. Here no benefactor is mentioned, which perhaps suggests that the king’s edict relates to the disbursement of wealth that is regularly donated in small amounts by many individuals.</p>
            <p rend="stanza" n="5">We could have taken the expression <foreign>mādhave mādhave</foreign> distributively to mean in “every month of Vaiśākha”, but since the element niyata- already expresses fixedness and therefore calendrical regularity, there is no need for the repetition of mādhave to express this. Indeed this repetition seems elegant precisely because the word is used in two different senses. Admittedly one could argue that <foreign>niyata</foreign>- is instead used to qualify the festival as “restrained”, in other words a ceremony in which the participants were expected to restrain themselves from sensual enjoyment and fix their minds on the Buddha and his teachings. But this might seem an anachronistically post-protestant interpretation, since Hindu and Buddhist festival processions often allow a joyful inversion of norms. This is furthermore arguably suggested by the opening <foreign>mādhave</foreign>, “In Springtime !...”, a time for joyous festivals all over the world from time immemorial.
            We have silently assumed that <foreign>pratimā-gamanam</foreign> is intended as a metrically expedient alternative to some more standard expression for a procession, such as <foreign>pratimāyātrā</foreign>, although it is just conceivable that it refers to “the approaching of the Buddha image <supplied reason="explanation">for veneration</supplied>” <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>pratimā-āgamanam</foreign></supplied>. Still, this is less likely, since the image, once installed, was presumably always there to be approached, not just on some calendrical festival. Festivals archetypically involve processions <supplied reason="explanation">in South India invariably so, to the point that utsava is often used to mean “procession”, e.g. in the expression <foreign>utsavamūrti</foreign></supplied>. For other allusions to religious processions in the Khmer epigraphical corpus, see <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00290.xml">K. 290</ref> <supplied reason="explanation">9th c., st. LXVI–LXVII, Buddhist</supplied>; <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00853.xml">K. 853</ref> <supplied reason="explanation">9th c., st. XIV, Śaiva</supplied>; <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00356.xml">K. 356</ref> <supplied reason="explanation">10th c., st. XI, a processional image, described as <foreign>utsavayāyin</foreign>, of a golden Viṣṇu mounted upon a silver Garuḍa</supplied>; <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00276.xml">K. 276</ref> <supplied reason="explanation">11th c., lines 4–6, Śaiva</supplied>; <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00277.xml">K. 277</ref> <supplied reason="explanation">11th c., lines 33–34, Śaiva</supplied>; <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK01222.xml">K. 1222</ref> <supplied reason="explanation">12th c., Southern face, Śaiva</supplied>. See also the passages referred to by Bhattacharya in his brief discussion of the subject (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Bhattacharya1961_01"/><citedRange unit="page">89–91</citedRange></bibl>, to which we have alluded above. There are numerous other references of course to utsavas, such as a Śaiva one in <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00055.xml">K. 55</ref>, st. 14, which also belongs to the seventh century, but without explicit references to processions or processional images.

            <p rend="stanza" n="6">As for <foreign>dāsa</foreign> and <foreign>karmakara</foreign> <supplied reason="explanation">which latter are presumably servants with a different legal status from the <foreign>dāsa</foreign>s, perhaps because they are not as completely owned</supplied>, the Śaiva author Brahmaśambhu draws this distinction in his Naimittikakriyānusandhāna of 938 CE. According to this text <supplied reason="explanation">f. 73v</supplied>,  when the religious master <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>ācārya</foreign></supplied> transfers his responsibilities to his successor,  he should say:

<foreign>idaṁ sthānam iyaṁ vr̥ttir iyaṁ pustakasaṁhatiḥ
amī vai bharaṇīyās tu dāsāḥ karmakarāś ca naḥ
etat sarvaṁ mayā tubhyaṁ dattam adya tvayāpi ca
pālanīyaṁ tathā samyag yathāsmābhiḥ prapālitam</foreign>

“Such is the foundation; such is the revenue; such is the library; and these are the slaves and workers that are to be supported. All this I have given to you this day, and you should properly maintain it as I have done.”

            <p rend="stanza" n="7">The Governor mentioned here is presumably one of the successors to Vidyāviśeṣa, the governor of Tamandarapura who authored <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00604.xml">K. 604</ref> and <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK01235.xml">K. 1235</ref> in 627 CE <supplied reason="explanation">for editions and translations of which, see Goodall (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Goodall2019_01"/></bibl>)</supplied>. The fact that this figure is assigned the administrative burden of ensuring the correct use of these resources seems indeed to confirm that we may speak of him as a “governor” <supplied reason="explanation">as argued by Goodall, 2019 passim</supplied>. It was clear already that the various other mentions of Tamandarapura in the epigraphic corpus <supplied reason="explanation"><ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00009.xml">K. 9</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK00604.xml">K. 604</ref> and <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK01235.xml">K. 1235</ref></supplied>, when all taken together, suggested the location somewhere in South Vietnam. The discovery of <ref target="DHARMA_INSCIK01426.xml">K. 1426</ref> at Oc Eo might indicate that Tamandarapura was in fact the ancient name of Óc Eo. As for the nature of the compound name Tamandarapura, which, apart from the element -pura, does not seem to be Sanskrit, see the summary of past discussions given by Goodall (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Goodall2019_01"/><citedRange unit="page">29</citedRange></bibl>), quoting Vickery (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Vickery1998_01"/><citedRange unit="page">182–183</citedRange></bibl>) and correspondence with Griffiths, and see Chhom and Griffiths <supplied reason="explanation">forthcoming, p. 102</supplied>, where we conclude: 

While <foreign>pura</foreign> means ‘city’ in Sanskrit, the element <foreign>tamandara</foreign> is hard to explain in Sanskrit or Khmer and may perhaps reflect an indigenous language of the Austronesian family: in Malay, for instance, <foreign>taman darat</foreign> could mean ‘flatland garden’, and it is likely that a very similar expression also existed in the ancient Cham language. So the name may be an indication that the ethnolinguistic profile of the ancient Mekong Delta, and the polity of Fu-nan, included other people beside Khmers.

            <p n="B4">Regarding the term <foreign>saṁ paribhoga</foreign>, the reproductions at our disposal make it imaginable that the dot we interpret as anusvāra is actually accidental, which would allow reading <foreign>saparibhoga</foreign>. Previous scholars have sometimes hesitated between <foreign>saṁ paribhoga</foreign> and <foreign>saparibhoga</foreign> <supplied reason="explanation">see e.g. the note in Cœdès 1936 on the inscription K. 6</supplied>. But it is probably undesirable to read <foreign>saparibhoga</foreign>, as the expression is attested multiple times with or without <foreign>p</foreign>- prefix as <foreign>psaṁ paribhoga</foreign>, often with clear presence of <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> <supplied reason="explanation">see further occurrences in the inscriptions K. 51, K. 163, K. 426, K. 561, K. 582, K. 600, K. 818, K. 904, K. 926 and K. 1275 </supplied>.</p>
         <p n="B6">Regarding ther term <foreign>kloñ ñan</foreign>, it might be read <foreign>kloñña n<unclear>aṁ</unclear></foreign> “superintendent of temple <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>naṁ</foreign> = <foreign>vnaṁ</foreign></supplied>” but this would yield a unique example of the word vnaṁ followed by the preposition <foreign>ai</foreign> “at”. Nevertheless, there are several examples in the pre-Angkorian inscriptions where <foreign>vnaṁ</foreign> stands in front of a name.</p>
            <p n="B12">The restitution of the world <foreign>dap</foreign> is based on both the meaning and the space on the stone. Given that the prohibitive word <foreign>dap</foreign> is followed by the word <foreign>pre</foreign> or <foreign>tel pre</foreign> in three previous phrases, the same wording is expected in the lost passage here. Nevertheless, the available space is too large for the word <foreign>pre</foreign> and too small for <foreign>tel pre</foreign>. The meaning of <foreign>dap</foreign> suits the context better than that of <foreign>pre</foreign> “to use, to order”.</p>

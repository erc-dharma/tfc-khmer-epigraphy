Arranged in two columns, the Sanskrit verses are carved in a calligraphic manner and in three prosodic meters: Upajāti of Triṣṭubh <supplied reason="explanation">st. I, II, IV, VI, VIII, IX, XI</supplied>, Indravajrā <supplied reason="explanation">st. III, V, VII</supplied> and Upendravajrā <supplied reason="explanation">st. X</supplied>. The first three stanzas contain an invocation of the gods Śiva, Śiva-Viṣṇu and Viṣṇu. Stanza IV praises king Īśānavarmman as king of kings. Stanzas V–VIII present the protagonist, a king’s servant <supplied reason="explanation">

                     </supplied> of the king called Vrau Etta, and record his installation of several divine images and donations of paddy-fields and cattle. An imprecation is pronounced in stanza IX. The last two stanzas specify that the installation of an image of Hara-Kṛṣṇa <supplied reason="explanation">Śiva-Viṣṇu</supplied> by the founder <supplied reason="explanation">Vrau Etta</supplied> happened on the first night of the lunar month of Caitra <supplied reason="explanation">March-April</supplied> of year 555 in the Śaka era, i.e. in 633 CE.

whose glory <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>°śrīḥ</foreign></supplied> and heroism <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>°parākrama°</foreign></supplied> are those of a king of kings who is alone on the surface <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>°pr̥ṣṭha°</foreign></supplied> of the earth <supplied reason="subaudible"/>[which is in the] Suvarṇabhūmi up to the oceans <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>samudraparyanta°</foreign></supplied>.
For a historiography of the term Suvarṇabhūmi, see our comment in the Khmer version of this article. In this volume, Vong Sotheara also discusses this term at length from a historical point of view.

            <p rend="stanza" n="5">Vrau Etta may be a name with a beneficent connotation. For a discussion on this name, see Michel Antelme’s article in Khmer in the next issue of Kambuja Suriya.</p>
            <p rend="stanza" n="5">According to D. Goodall <supplied reason="explanation">personal communication, December 2019</supplied>, this seems to be the name of a Viṣṇu with a Śaiva-sounding element, see the remaks of A. Griffiths <supplied reason="explanation">2005</supplied> on the Vaiṣṇava theonym Tribhuvaneśvara in K. 1214. The installation of the god Puṣkareśa is also mentioned in two contemporary inscriptions, K. 121 <supplied reason="explanation">638 śaka, Preah Theat Kvan Pir, Kratie province</supplied> and K. 765 <supplied reason="explanation">601 śaka, Prasat Neang Khmau, Takeo province</supplied>.</p>
            <p rend="stanza" n="6">D. Goodall <supplied reason="explanation">personal communication, December 2019</supplied> thinks that Svayambhudevī is the name of the goddess, who is presented as the sister of Murāri, perhaps because she is thought of as Subhadrā <supplied reason="explanation">and the last stanza might be taken to suggest that the Viṣṇu is a Kr̥ṣṇa here</supplied>, but perhaps also because Viṣṇu gives Pārvatī to Śiva when Śiva marries her <supplied reason="explanation">as represented, e.g., in South Indian Kalyāṇasundaramūrtis</supplied>, and the goddess, both in Cambodia and in Tamil Nadu, bears <foreign>cakra</foreign> and <foreign>śaṅkha</foreign> <supplied reason="explanation">even when she appears in Śaiva contexts</supplied>.</p>
            <p rend="stanza" n="11">It is most probable that <foreign>vīnā</foreign> is to be corrected into <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>vīṇā</foreign></supplied> which generally means ‘Indian lute’ but in astrology, according to M. Monier-Williams <supplied reason="explanation">2005: 1005</supplied> it can refer to a particular configuration of the stars <supplied reason="explanation">when all planets are situated in seven houses</supplied>. Nevertheless, the meaning does not seem to fit in this context, where a name of a zodiac sign is expected.</p>

                  <summary>This inscription in 6 Sanskrit verses in elaborate metres begins (stanza 1) with praise of a deity, perhaps Brahmā, then (stanza 2) praises of a king, whose name is lost to damage, then (stanza 3) further praise of the king in which he is likened to an avatāra of Viṣṇu, then
                          (stanza 4) what may be still further praise of the king likening him to Hanumān (?), then (stanza 5) praise of a city whose name is not Sanskritic.  That city may be either compared with Hastināpurī and Dvāravatī, or it stands at the head of a list in which Hastināpurī and Dvāravatī are also included. The final stanza (6)
                          enumerates the gifts of gold, cattle, lands and slaves that the king gave to Paśupati (presumably there was a śiva-liṅga at this place).</summary>

                     <p>The lettering is similar to that of seventh-century Khmer epigraphs, but with unusually elongated
                               descending and ascending strokes, volutes and flourishes.  The ā-mātra, for instance, is sometimes short and business-like, but sometimes is allowed to descend well below the body of the character to which it is attached and to loop underneath it. This recalls C8th records, such as K. 1254.  But the archaic shape of most instances of the retroflex ṇ instead recalls fifth-century records such as K. 875. Arguably another archaism is the dropped miniaturised final m, apparently with a virāma beneath it, in the last line.  Such miniaturised letters are found in old records from various parts of the Indian world (for instance in Licchavi inscriptions), but we know of none from Khmer records.
                             A discussion of their use elsewhere in Southeast Asia, however, may be found in <bibl>

<div type="commentary">
		<p rend="stanza" n="2">The last syllables of the line are visible on the photograph sent by John Guy, but not on the photos published in the Silpakorn journal.</p>
        <p rend="stanza" n="3">Presumably this stanza presents the king as an incarnation  (<foreign>avatāra</foreign>) of Viṣṇu, yearned for by the gods.</p>

        <p rend="stanza" n="4">Perhaps the king is comparing himself here to Hanumān?</p>

         <p rend="stanza" n="5">It is not at all clear how to divide up the first twelve syllables of this stanza.  Could it be a single toponym: Śrīyānaṁdimiriṅgamapratipuraṁ?
         Or is <foreign>apratipuram</foreign> intended to mean “without a [comparable] counterpart city”, in which case Śrīyānaṁdimiriṅga could be the toponym?  And is <foreign>śrī</foreign> a detachable honorific, in which case Yānaṁdimiriṅga could be the name?
       As evidence of Dvāravatī as the name of the principal city of the period and area, this is not unambiguous, since one could instead understand that the first city mentioned is
       in fact only compared with Hastinākhyapurī and with Viṣṇu's legendary city Dvāravatī.  It is, however, also possible, as our translation suggests, that we have an enumeration of cities, the name of the first of which being uncertain, then Hastināpurī and Dvāravatī, and then a fourth place introduced with <foreign>etac ca</foreign>.
       Although the photograph sent by John Guy generally shows more details than any of the others, and contains a fragment at the end of the second line that is not in the other photographs, there is a fragment that it does not show that is in one of the photographs published in the Silpakorn journal.  That fragment has the tops of the syllables <foreign>gdarasadma</foreign> in the fourth quarter of stanza 5.
       It is possible that the fragment in question is not in fact in the right place.</p>

       <p rend="stanza" n="6">There are numerous points out of doubt in the transcription here.
       We are assuming, for instance, that the vowel mātrā for e (in <foreign>ekaṁ śatam</foreign>) is written above the letter like part of an ai.  Furthermore, we seem to see a miniaturised final <foreign>m</foreign> dropped beneath the line at the end of <foreign>śatam</foreign>.  Such dropped miniaturised letters (in this case perhaps with a <foreign>virāma</foreign>-mark beneath it) are found in the Indian subcontinent, but in Khmer epigraphy there may be no parallel. Particularly tentative is the reconstruction of the word <foreign>mahiṣikam</foreign> (which is lexicalised as <foreign>mahīṣika</foreign>mahīṣika).

         <div type="commentary">
          <p>Finot's French translation suggests that there were statues of both of Yajñavarāha's professors, which is perhaps not impossible, but there is only one word for statue, namely <foreign>nimā</foreign>, which is singular and in compound with <foreign>vāgīśvarī°</foreign>. It seems therefore worth recording the possibility, as the second (English) translation attempts, that there was only one statue, of Sarasvatī (who tends to be called Vāgīśvarī in Śaiva contexts), erected out of devotion to (<foreign>bhaktyā</foreign>) or honour of two teachers.  As for the use of the term <foreign>vidyāguru</foreign>, it might be to distinguish these figures from other sorts of guru, for instance from Yajñavarāha's initiator (<foreign>dīkṣāguru</foreign>).   Archeological evidence on the site might reveal how many images were in fact installed there.</p>

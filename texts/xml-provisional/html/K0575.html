It seems therefore worth recording the possibility, as the second (English) translation attempts, that there was only one statue, of Sarasvatī (who tends to be called Vāgīśvarī in Śaiva contexts), erected out of devotion to (<span class="lang">bhaktyā</span>) or honour of two teachers. As for the use of the term <span class="lang">vidyāguru</span>, it might be to distinguish these figures from other sorts of guru, for instance from Yajñavarāha's initiator (<span class="lang">dīkṣāguru</span>). Archeological evidence on the site might reveal how many images were in fact installed there.</p>  </div>  <div id="bibliography"><h2>bibliography</h2>  <p/>  <ul> EFEO Estampage n. 426.

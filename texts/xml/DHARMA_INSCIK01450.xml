                  <summary>The inscription praises a courtier whose name is not likely to be mentioned in the readable portion of the inscription. He seems to be previously a priest at the temple Śrī Śikharīśvara (Preah Vihear) and head of his own corporation or clerical order (ātmavarṇṇa) called Amara before serving the king (who is probably to be identified as Sūryavarman I). By his expertise in Vedic and Āgamic rituals, he was appointed by the king as chief of sacrificial hall of fire and chief of royal priests. He was a devout worshiper of God Śiva. Out of devotion, he installed statues in four sacred sites beginning with Śrī Śikharīśvara (Preah Vihear). At the temple Śrī Śikharīśvara, he installed golden images of Nandin and Mahākāla along with villages, servants and lands. At other temples made of stone and brick beginning with Parameśvara (Preah Ko), he installed various śivaliṅgas and gods’ images. Furthermore, he installed many metal and gold images of gods and liṅgas at temples such as Phalapriya and resided at religious places like Bhadreśvara (Vat Phu). There, he conducted many rites (pūjā) for Śiva and offered paraphernalia such as palanquins, parasols and other ornaments, together with grains, servants, cows, buffaloes, horses, elephants, cattle and lands. He made many considerable water bodies flowing into channels running through places where there were roads and made gardens along the roads with plenty of fruits and shade.
                     He belonged perhaps to a family of five brothers; he, being the youngest, yet the most skillful and glorious. He was comparable to Arjuna, supposedly the best among the five Pāṇḍava brothers in the Mahābhārata. It is probable that he was appointed as a teacher at the temple Śrī Śikharīśvara, possibly a chief of court of justice and later, a chief of a district (viṣaya). The king married his daughter to him, the highest of royal favours.
